Development:

 I started working on my front-end after the completion of my express repo. I set up the auths files and included api.js, events.js, and ui.js. Then I made a products folder for my POST, PATCH, and DELETE components. During this project, I struggled a bit with update and delete because I did not realize I was calling the incorrect data into my api.js file. When running into problems I referred back to the documentations and lessons to solve the prroblems. Then I opened up an issue to reach out to instructors and classmates for some extra help.

Unsolved Problems:
I want to add review and images so that users can write and upload images along with their product. I also want to display the products in a grid like formation rather than in a vertical line. I would like to have each owner display when they create a new product so other users can see which products belong to who. I would like to add a lot more stying.

User stories:

As a user I want to sign up and sign in
As a user I want to be able to change my password
As a user I want to sign out
As a user I want to create new products with details
As a user I want to view all products
As a user I want to update and delete products I have already created

This application allows a user to create a product with a name and text section where they can name their product and explain to others what their product is and what they think about it. I wanted to create an app where people can share their product and reviews for others can see before purchasing.
